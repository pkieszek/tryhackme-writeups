## Task 1 – Introduction  
In this task, you're asked to start the AttackBox and launch Metasploit using the `msfconsole` command. This is just an initial setup step.

**Answer:** No answer required

---

## Task 2 – Scanning  
This section focuses on using Metasploit's built-in scanners to identify open ports and services.

- **Q2: How many ports are open on the target system?**  
  **Answer:** 5

- **Q3: Using the appropriate scanner, what NetBIOS name do you see?**  
  **Answer:** ACME IT SUPPORT

- **Q4: What service is running on port 8000?**  
  **Answer:** webfs/1.21

- **Q5: What is the SMB password for the user "penny"?**  
  **Answer:** leo1234

## Task 3 – The Metasploit Database  
This task introduces the Metasploit database and its use in organizing scanned host data and modules.

**Answer:** No answer required

---

## Task 4 – Vulnerability Scanning  
Here, you use Metasploit to check for specific vulnerabilities such as open mail relays.

- **Q7: Who wrote the module for scanning SMTP servers for open relay?**  
  **Answer:** Campbell Murray

---

## Task 5 – Exploitation  
This part involves exploiting one of the critical vulnerabilities on the target system and gathering information.

- **Q8: Exploit one of the critical vulnerabilities on the target VM**  
  **Answer:** No answer required

- **Q9: What is the content of the flag.txt file?**  
  **Answer:** THM-5455554845

- **Q10: What is the NTLM hash of the password of the user "pirate"?**  
  **Answer:** 8ce9a3ebd1647fcc5e04025019f4b875

## Task 6 – Msfvenom  
This task walks through creating and delivering a custom payload to a remote machine using Msfvenom and obtaining a Meterpreter session.

- **Q11–Q15:**  
  These are hands-on steps involving:
  - Logging into the remote machine as user `murphy`
  - Generating a `.elf` payload with `msfvenom`
  - Transferring the file using a Python HTTP server and `wget`
  - Executing it to get a Meterpreter session
  - Using post-exploitation modules to dump password hashes

- **Q16: What is the other user’s password hash?**  
  **Answer:** `$6$Sy0NNIXw$SJ27WltHI89hwM5UxqVGiXidj94QFRm2Ynp9p9kxgVbjrmtMez9EqXoDWtcQd8rf0tjc77hBFbWxjGmQCTbep0`

## Task 7 – Summary  
This final section summarizes what you’ve learned: scanning, identifying services, exploiting vulnerabilities, creating payloads, and performing post-exploitation techniques.

**Answer:** No answer required

---

**Final Notes:**  
This room is an excellent introduction to practical exploitation with Metasploit. It covers the entire workflow—from enumeration to post-exploitation—and is especially useful for beginners looking to get hands-on with real-world tools.
